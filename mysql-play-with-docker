When setting up the **DMS Source Endpoint**, you would use this as the **Server name** in the AWS DMS setup for MySQL.

Here’s how you should use it in your DMS Source Endpoint setup:

- **Server name**: `ip172-18-0-25-cuq7jggl2o9000blegng-3306.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com`
- **Port**: `3306`
- **Username**: The MySQL user you created (e.g., `dmsuser`).
- **Password**: The password for the MySQL user (e.g., `password`).

Then proceed with setting up the migration task and follow the steps as mentioned previously.


#############################################################################


To migrate data from your MySQL container running in **Play with Docker** to an AWS database using **AWS DMS**, follow these steps.

### **AWS DMS Migration Steps**

#### **1. Prerequisites**
Before proceeding with DMS, ensure you have the following:

- An **AWS account**.
- **MySQL container** running on Play with Docker, accessible from the internet.
- **Amazon RDS** or any other **AWS database** as the target (in this case, let’s assume Amazon RDS for MySQL).
- The **source MySQL database** (running in Docker) should be properly configured with access credentials and database schema.

---

#### **2. Set Up DMS on AWS**

1. **Create a VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud):
   - If not already done, create a VPC for your AWS environment. This will allow the AWS DMS replication instance to communicate securely with your source and target databases.
   - Ensure that the security group attached to the VPC allows inbound access to port `3306` (MySQL) for the source database from DMS replication instances.

2. **Create a DMS Replication Instance**:
   - Go to **AWS DMS Console** → **Replication Instances**.
   - Click **Create replication instance**.
   - Specify the **instance class** and **allocated storage** based on your workload (e.g., `dms.r5.large`).
   - Choose **VPC** and configure network settings for the replication instance.
   - Allow for any necessary public access for your Play with Docker container.

3. **Create the Source Endpoint (MySQL container)**:
   - Go to **AWS DMS Console** → **Endpoints** → **Create endpoint**.
   - **Source endpoint type**: Select `Source`.
   - **Endpoint identifier**: Enter something like `mysql-source`.
   - **Database engine**: Choose `MySQL`.
   - **Server name**: Enter the **Play with Docker external IP** or DNS of the machine running the MySQL container (e.g., `<Play_with_Docker_IP>:3306`).
   - **Port**: `3306`.
   - **Username**: The MySQL user (`dmsuser`) you created earlier.
   - **Password**: The password you assigned to `dmsuser` (e.g., `password`).
   - **Test the connection** to ensure the connection is successful.
   - Save the source endpoint.

4. **Create the Target Endpoint (Amazon RDS MySQL)**:
   - Go to **AWS DMS Console** → **Endpoints** → **Create endpoint**.
   - **Target endpoint type**: Select `Target`.
   - **Endpoint identifier**: Enter something like `rds-mysql-target`.
   - **Database engine**: Choose `MySQL`.
   - **Server name**: Enter the **RDS MySQL endpoint** (you can find this in the RDS console).
   - **Port**: `3306`.
   - **Username**: The MySQL user for RDS.
   - **Password**: The password for RDS MySQL user.
   - **Test the connection** to ensure the connection is successful.
   - Save the target endpoint.

---

#### **3. Create the DMS Migration Task**

1. **Create a DMS Migration Task**:
   - Go to **AWS DMS Console** → **Database migration tasks** → **Create task**.
   - **Task identifier**: Provide a name for your task (e.g., `mysql-to-rds-task`).
   - **Replication instance**: Choose the replication instance you created earlier.
   - **Source endpoint**: Select `mysql-source` (your MySQL container).
   - **Target endpoint**: Select `rds-mysql-target` (your RDS MySQL database).
   - **Migration type**: Choose `Migrate existing data` (if you want to migrate the current data) or `Migrate existing data and replicate ongoing changes` (if you want to replicate changes after the initial migration).
   - **Table mappings**: Set up the rules to define which tables to migrate. For this, you can use the **default** settings if you want to migrate the entire schema or create custom rules.
   - **Transformation rules**: Optional. You can set up rules to modify the data during migration (e.g., converting column names).
   - **Task settings**: Choose the desired settings, such as logging options.

2. **Start the Task**:
   - Once the task is created, **start the migration task** by clicking **Start task**.
   - The DMS task will now start migrating data from your MySQL source (Play with Docker) to the target RDS MySQL database.

---

#### **4. Monitor the Migration**

- Go to the **DMS Console** → **Tasks** to monitor the status of your migration task.
- The task will show the status of the migration, such as:
  - **Creating endpoint**: When DMS is establishing the connection.
  - **Ready**: When the replication task is waiting to start.
  - **Running**: When data is actively being migrated.
  - **Completed**: When the task completes successfully.
  - **Error**: If any issues occur during migration, you can view the error details and take corrective actions.

---

#### **5. Verify the Migration**

- After the migration task is complete, check your **RDS MySQL database** to verify that the data has been copied over successfully.
- Run queries on the RDS database to confirm the data and schema match the source database in your MySQL container.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

You should see the same data as in the source database (MySQL container).

---

### **Summary of Steps**
1. Set up **AWS DMS** with a replication instance.
2. Create **source** (Play with Docker MySQL) and **target** (RDS MySQL) endpoints.
3. Configure the **migration task**.
4. Monitor the task progress.
5. Verify the migrated data in the RDS MySQL database.
